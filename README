Adding new service
==================

To add support for your service, you need to subclass from
phoupl.core.PhotoUploader and implement _connect and _upload methods.
You also need to register new service using
phoupl.register_service('service_name', ServiceClass). Then place your
module int phoupl/services directory and it should work :-).
