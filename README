Photo uploader
==============

This is simple photo uploader for minilabs. Basic usage is described by
online help, just issue photo-upload --help.

To upload photo to some service, just invoke something like this:
photo-upload -s service_name image1.jpg /folder/with/images/*.jpg


Supported service features
==========================

You can get list of services by photo-upload -l.

Description of features:
    - new - supports creating of new session
    - reuse - supports reusing of existing session
    - cookies - requires cookie injection to browser on new session


Adding new service
==================

To add support for your service, you need to subclass from
phoupl.core.PhotoUploader and implement _connect and _upload methods.
You also need to register new service using phoupl.register_service.
Then place your module int phoupl/services directory and it should work
:-).


Using in applications
=====================

If you want to use photo-uploader in your applications, please be
careful, because it is in very early stage of development and almost
everything can change.

If you want to parse photo-upload -l output, you can rely it will be
always formatted like Debian control files (see Debian Policy Manual at
<http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html> for
detailed description). Name field is required all others are basically
optional and new fields can be added by later versions.
